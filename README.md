# Spaceman - Project 1

Introduction
---------------------

Spaceman is a one-player puzzle game, in which the program will randomly select a guess word, which a player will then have to guess by selecting the letters that make up said word. The play is able to make 10 incorrect guesses, before they run out of chances and the game is over. If the player chooses the correct letter, their number of remaining chances does not diminish. If the player is able to guess the word correctly without exceeding the max number of incorrect guesses, they win. If a player is having some difficulty with a particular word, they can click the "Hint" button to recieve a clue as to what the guess word is.

Challenges
---------------------

- The most challenging part of this project was creating the logic for the game; specifically, setting the random guess word as dashes by default and converting the corresponding dashes to the properly guessed letter.

- Ensuring that I was practicing DRY code which can be scalable.

- Using CSS to properly format the game and make it dynamic so that everything looks proper across all window sizes.
