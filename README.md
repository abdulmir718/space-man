# space-man
Spaceman s a one-player game, in which the computer will randomly select a word or phrase and the player will have a finite amount of chances to guess what it is. If the player is able to guess the word/phrase correctly within their allotted tires, they win. If they run out of tries before they guess it correctly, they lose.
